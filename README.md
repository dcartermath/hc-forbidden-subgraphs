# Hadwiger's Conjecture with Certain Forbidden Induced Subgraphs
This repository hosts code for the paper "Hadwiger's Conjecture with Certain Forbidden Induced Subgraphs." The files hp_figure, i_figure, and edges_figure contain the TeX/TikZ source of Figures 3, 4, and 5, respectively. These are read by verify.py, which implements the various algorithms described in the paper in order to prove the main theorem, Theorem 2, according to the outline in Figure 5. Each line of output is of the from *graph1* *graph2* *count* *weight*, respectively denoting the starting graph, ending graph, total count of intermediate graphs, and the so-called total weight of the intermediate graphs.

Running verify.py requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.9.6, [igraph-python](https://igraph.org/python) version 0.9.11, and [PySAT](https://pysathq.github.io/) version 0.1.7.dev19, though it probably works fine with newer versions as well. The code may take several minutes or hours to run, depending on how powerful your computer is.

The program k8.py verifies Theorem 3. This requires [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) version 2.8.3, and as before newer versions also likely work fine. Additionally, one should download and unzip the file r38_27.g6 from [http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/ramsey.html](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/ramsey.html), containing the graph data for graphs with 27 vertices and no triangle or stable set of size 8.
